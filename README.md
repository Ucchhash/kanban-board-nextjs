# Kanban Board with NextJS and Tailwind

## Introduction

This is an ongoing project of mine.I'm continuously working on it to add new features and functionality to make it a fully functional Kanban Board app.
Right now it has only 'Add Task' feature and 'Drag and Drop' functionality.
For drag and drop functionality, I used a package called 'react-beautiful-dnd'

## How to Use

First, install all the dependencies

    yarn

Then run the development server

    yarn dev
